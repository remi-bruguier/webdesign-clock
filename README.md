Web Designers Android Clock
==============

First little experiment about Android Development.
Made with a lot of fun for this [TreeHouse Forum Contest](https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/forum-contest-build-an-android-clock-app-2)

Just a Basic clock, with a few unusual features.

Swipe to the left: changes the background color with one picked from [flatuicolors.com](http://flatuicolors.com/)

Swipe to the right: changes the font with one picked from [FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) amongst the most popular ones.

Shake your device : Resets the background color and the font with a sound effet :3

Includes a custom launcher icon.
